Code to drive a pneumatic cylinder and some LEDs
The physical project is a mock-up demo of a high energy DC spark ignitor used in fuel burning boilers and furnaces.  The pneumatic cylinder introduces the ignitor tip into the fuel/air stream for reliable/safe ignition of the fuel, then retracts back out of the flame kernel and heat to a safe, cooler area to protect the ignitor tip from damage.  The flashing LED is to simulate the sparking pattern of the ignitor.  There is another glowing/breathing LED on the start button of this project.
